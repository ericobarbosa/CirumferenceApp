# Circumference App

A simple, interactive web app that calculates the circumference of a circle based on a user-inputted radius. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes input validation and rounding functionality for a polished user experience.

## 📐 Features

- **Radius Input**: Enter any positive number as the radius.
- **Error Handling**: Real-time input validation prevents non-numeric values.
- **Precision Control**: Choose how many decimal places to round the answer to (0–5).
- **Calculation Logic**: Uses the formula `Circumference = 2 × π × radius`.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, centered layout styled with custom CSS.

## 🎯 Purpose & Usefulness

This project demonstrates:
- How to handle user input and validation in JavaScript.
- Basic mathematical operations and rounding techniques.
- DOM manipulation and screen transitions.
- Clean user interface design with responsive elements.

It's great for practicing beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript logic and working with forms and event listeners.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
